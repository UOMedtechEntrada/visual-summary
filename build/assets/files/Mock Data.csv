07/18/2018,Resident_001,1.1,Faculty_001,Clinical Supervisor,3,Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1,simple,"-Good job getting vitals and placing oxygen.
-Took awhile to order an ECG or any investigations. These things can often be done simultaneously with physical exam and history. Were ultimately prompted to do this by the nurse and I would have prompted you in real life.
-Stated that it would be ""A good time to mobilize some of the other nurses and the physician"" but didn't really mention exactly what you wanted done. The nurse asked for clarification and you called me, but I don't think any additional nursing resources were mobilized. In the future know what you need the extra staff for and be explicit with what you are requesting.
-During the call you mentioned the SpO2 but without that she was on O2. Only mentioned bradycardia but didn't mention possibility of cardiogenic shock. Try to put some labels on things like this to assist and expedite communication.
-ABG probably not necessary at all for this case. VBG would have been reasonable and faster, especially initially.
-ECG interpretation of sinus brady at 35 with no note of the ischemia. Required prompting for interpretation (although not really part of the EPA). Noted that he needed to actually go through his approach of ECG interpretation but didn't do that and therefore missed a finding he would have seen.
-You ordered both pacemaker and dopamine ready at the same time and were asked about the pacer or dopamine first by the nurse. This would be the time to ask for additional nurses to help out!",
07/18/2018,Resident_001,1.1,Faculty_002,Clinical Supervisor,4,Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1,simple,"Asked for labs immediately upon entering the room, tasked nurse to do this while she was getting patient hooked up to monitors - labs can wait (nobody's life was saved because we drew a blood test...they will get back in an hour, so an extra 5-10 minutes won't matter).  ECG is more important - impacts management.  Make sure you don't tax your nurse with too many things - orders get missed and they don't know which one is most important.  It's your job to decide the most important tasks to be completed when you are in a resus.

Ordered 1L RL bolus once he was tachycardia and soft BP - good.  Got crash cart connected.  Did FAST scan.  Got ECG.  Decided to call attending at this point.  Gave a narrative story with chronological interventions.  Try to be more clear/to the point about why you are calling: 'I need help, I have a sick patient' is usually enough to get you attending there. 'I have a shocky patient who is complaining of CP and a normal ECG'.

Once hypotensive, asked for 2 units blood (O POS).  Patient improved.",
07/18/2018,Resident_001,1.1,Faculty_001,Clinical Supervisor,4,Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1,simple,"-Good job getting history and physical simultaneous with vital signs. Started IVF and oxygen as soon as you saw the vitals. Oxygen order was appropriately specific.
-Asked regarding the flow rate and responded with '30cc/kg' and then 'over 20 minutes.' I would suggest specifying a bolus. Possibly even specify pressure bag and gravity line in this case.
-You stated ""she is able to talk pretty well"" after the patient had just been mumbling to you. A bit of sim artifact in this case, however, notice that this is a change for her since she arrived. In discussion, this was sim artifact.
-Don't specify individual labs in this case - order sets were made for verbal orders! If you specify
-Call to me: Noted her vitals and that she was quite sick and went very around the bush to get to 'septic shock.' Lead with septic shock not improving with fluids!
-Lactate isn't so exciting in this case - we know that she's in septic shock! Don't focus on this too much as it's not going to change our management.
-Good job requesting a second nurse as you note that there is a lot going on. I would suggest being specific in your prioritization of what you want between getting the Tazo ready and getting the norepinephrine ready.
-Pressor dose - look it up unless you're really confident!",
07/23/2018,Resident_001,1.1,Faculty_003,Clinical Supervisor,3,Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1,complex patient characteristic,"Overall you did a fair job in the initial assessment and treatment of this patient.  You required a number of prompts to return to the patient to complete specific exam components or retrieve historical aspects of the case.  Once you recognize someone as critically ill, think of them as such and perform a complete systems based examination and history.  Directed history and physical exam goes out the window in the critically ill; address acute threats to life and then go looking for etiology of illness. You want to be in the sweet spot of simultaneous Resuscitation-Investigation-Definitive treatment which will come with experience and training.  Overall good job.",
08/03/2018,Resident_001,1.1,Faculty_002,Clinical Supervisor,5,Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1,simple,Resident assessed a female after a wasp sting.  Objectively there was not much to find - bit of rash near the sting site and subjective SOB with no wheeze on auscultation.  Resident knew the criteria for anaphylaxis and employed targeted questioning and physical exam to identify it.  He stole chose to treat as anaphylaxis (which I agreed with) however it was a soft case and it not require him to get me involved early.  I did challenge him to avoid questions that did not alter his management plan (ie. routine asking about FHx in a middle aged adult is very unlikely to yield any useful information).,
08/07/2018,Resident_001,1.1,Faculty_004,Clinical Supervisor,2,Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1,complex clinical characteristic,"I had Resident assess this L2 trauma pt while I stood by and watched. This assessment is with the caveat that Resident has not yet completed ATLS. Prior to assessing the pt, we discussed the approach to trauma patients.

Resident did a full assessment, and was largely correct in his assessments. We discussed the approach to workup, and I verified some exam findings. Together, we made a plan. For eg. Resident suggested we do T/L XR, but with multiple small findings, I suggested we do a CT, on which there was a significant finding. He is doing well, and with ATLS and experience I expect him to be able to complete this assessment and disposition independently.",
09/02/2018,Resident_001,1.1,Faculty_005,Clinical Supervisor,2,Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1,complex patient characteristic,"Resident and I were seeing a severe chest pain when a second CTAS2 respiratory distress patient rolled in on the other side of the curtain. I left him to do the initial assessment and gather information. He is still getting his footing in a critical care scenario and two months into his first year of residency I wouldn't expect him to ""manage"" the case on his own. He was helpful and lead the discussion with a family member over the phone on quickly establishing the goals of care. He was calm and methodical. It was a great learning case for him as he did need quite a bit of prompts and feedback, will be nice to see him progress with the next case.",
09/19/2018,Resident_001,1.1,Faculty_002,Clinical Supervisor,4,Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1,"simulation, adult, complex patient characteristic, cardiorespiratory arrest","Resident took an initial history.  Considered seizure, syncope as causes.  This is a bit of a SIMism, but Resident had a completely stable patient, and approached it like a resus (2 large bore IVs, rapid fire questions with more of a SAMPLE history).  Resident started CPR without checking a pulse - seeing VF on monitor.  Asked nurse to call code blue.  She hooked up monitors, called code blue, then set up to shock.  Started post-cardiac care - ECG, called CCU.  Phone call: could clean it up a bit - a bit disorganized and too narrative.  Stick with the punch line - '55 y o VF arrest in the ED, down for 2 minutes, came back after 1 shock, stable now, can you come and see please'.  During debrief we talked about the lack of pulse check - I think it was reasonable given the context of the case (no signs of life, VF on monitor, had already fainted).  Part of this is Resident knowing something is going to happen in these cases - I encouraged to do what he would do in real life and not try to out-think the cases.",
09/19/2018,Resident_001,1.1,Faculty_001,Clinical Supervisor,3,Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1,"simulation, adult, simple, cardiorespiratory arrest","-Good job with initial vitals and history. Would like you to immediately consider PE with this story as the most likely diagnosis. Identifying that as a most likely diagnosis can help in communication with your staff. I would see having this basic information as being important in the mobilization of the team to allow clear communication with your attending.
-Quickly identified the patient losing their pulse
-Bed needs to be laid flat when you begin CPR
-Good job noting that you need to call a code and get help by doing so.",
09/19/2018,Resident_001,1.1,Faculty_001,Clinical Supervisor,3,Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1,"simulation, adult, simple, respiratory stress","-Asked for oxygen without knowing what the SpO2 was or having looked at the patient. Try not to do this reflexively as it is an intervention that the patient may not need.
-Reasonable history. Did not complete a quick primary survey (did not assess circulatory status outside of pulses; disability; exposure). I would encourage you to run through a quick primary so that it can help your other assessments.
-When the patient's sats were dropping despite oxygen I would suggest that this is a good time to call for help! You had already escalated a nonrebreather a minute or two before considering this.
-Call for help should start with a bit more orientation of me (in this case you started with vitals without the context that the patient had thoracic trauma). Over the phone your focus was on circulation when his respiratory status was decompensating the most and I didn't appreciate that (chest hurt the most, sats were low).

Additional notes:
-The bed needs to go down for CPR (it was on an angle)
-If it walks and talks like a pneumothorax it probably is - decompress quickly and if you think about it, plan to decompress (get the chest tube and needle ready).
-Decompressing a chest in someone that is a chest trauma patient who is shocky and hypoxic with no obvious blood loss is the right thing to do even before confirming the presence of a PTx.",

07/18/2018,Resident_002,1.1,Faculty_001,Clinical Supervisor,4,Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1,simple,"-Asked for a ton of things right off the bat - blood pressure, SpO2, Glucose, temperature. Nurse was already doing those things for you. Might miss one if you order these like this in real life. Prioritize if you want something first. Probably wouldn't do that in real life. Likely sim artifact.
-Reasonable start with vitals, IV's, nasal prongs, and ECG.
-ECG interpretation saw some ST changes but missed the 3rd degree AVB.
-Considered nitro but didn't give it due to lack of R sided ECG. This is not the reason you shouldn't have given it! BP was light, HR was ~40 when you mentioned this, and the patient had a 3rd degree block. I noted that I would prompt because I would have prompted based on this.
-Good call to your emergency physician. Lots of good information and in a good order with good brevity.
-Reasonable workup planned prior to consulting with the emergency physician. Notably, I mentioned a DOPAMINE infusion rather than a dobutamine infusion. Dobutamine probably wouldn't be appropriate in this situation as it could drop the blood pressure. You told me all about this when I came into the room so it's clear you knew it :)
-You mentioned in the debrief that she was in cardiogenic shock - great thing to label in the case!",
07/18/2018,Resident_002,1.1,Faculty_001,Clinical Supervisor,5,Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1,simple,"-Good job getting vitals and initial history
-Good labeling of sepsis and ordering of septic workup. Try not to do a list of labs with verbal orders. Got fluids ordered at the same time.
-Ordered oxygen when dropped below 92% which is reasonable.
-The patient stopped responding to you but you didn't seem to take note of that immediately. This is difficult with manikins, but be sure to pay attention that!
-Good job thinking ahead to next step with consideration of 'pressors' but if you do want the nurse to begin getting this ready (as you suggested) be sure to specify which one. Nice that you know your pressor doses, but you forgot the '/kg/' part the first time you said it. Watch that - those need to be very specific!",

This was a complicated case that challenged Dr Resident with respect to balancing intervention with investigation, application of strategies to manage rapid AFib given the decompsensating patient/the clinical setting, escalating care and identification of code status. Dr Resident required prompting in several aspects of the patient's care but had much of the basic knowledge base and approach to management that is expected of a new learner.  He appropriately identified that his patient was 'sick' and required a change in course of his treatment.",

Recognized rhythm change and change in LOC immediately.  Delegated nurse to start CPR, verbalized that he wanted to call a code blue, hooked up defib pads and shocked VF, called attending/code blue.  During debrief, Resident shared his frame around what to do first regarding hooking up defib pads or calling for help given there was only him and a nurse, and the nurse was doing compressions.  Resident recognized that the most important intervention to save the patient was to defib, and he would have a 2 minute window to call after shocking the patient.  I thought this was excellent use of prioritization.  We also discussed how to risk stratify syncope (vagal vs cardiac) and that escalating care initially in this case would have been excessive.  Simply having the patient on a monitor to recognize decompensation was sufficient.",

Patient arrested, Resident recognized this right away, directed CPR.  I came in as the attending at this point, and then took over once Resident had given 1 round of Epi.

AED use - Resident used the AED mode in both cases this morning that I observed.  He stated that this 'frees up hands' so he can do other things.  I encouraged him to use manual mode in the hospital setting.
Handover to attending - admitted he sort of 'let the attending take over and stopped thinking'.  I encouraged him to give a proper handover as the attending does have the same information as you do initially.
Explored why he called when he did - recognized the patient was quite sick and wanted to make sure his attending was aware of his plan.",

-'Start with Ringer's or Saline' - just pick one; it's simpler!
-Jumped from no oxygen to a NRB mask - I probably would have started with nasal prongs and escalated. This would allow you to have a more accurate idea of how much oxygen that they are actually requiring.

'Deteriorating rapidly' then gave me a chronological narrative story but got the point across, but could be more to the point.  Suggested blood transfusion, but asked for 4 units uncrossed (1-2 would be sufficient).  Worked well with RN, gave clear orders.

Nice job.",
07/18/2018,Resident_003,1.1,Faculty_001,Clinical Supervisor,3,Part A: Direct Observation - Form 1,simple,"-Reasonable history and physical occurring simultaneously with vital signs.
-Requested 'some oxygen' - be more explicit right from the beginning so the nurse doesn't need to prompt regarding how much oxygen.
-When ordering the pacer pads placed I do think it is reasonable to be really explicit in terms of why right from the beginning (especially if the patient appears to be pretty stable). You asked for the defibrillator which does imply defibrillation rather than pacing which also resulted in some confusion.
-You were worried about needing to pace her and gave atropine but didn't order an ECG until after! ECG can happen (along with blood work) simultaneously with the history and physical exam in a patient who is sick like this one. Your nurse was free during the physical exam and could have been helping with this. I would have definitely prompted for an ECG much earlier.
-Ordered atropine to be given prior to an ECG and also used some language noting that you were uncertain regarding its dose. This did not convey confidence and I suspect that the nurses would be quite concerned regarding this patient with unstable vitals and not knowing the doses for the medications for the resuscitation medications that are being ordered. This should prompt you to get help quicker.
-When giving verbal orders of labs I would suggest using 'workups' rather than specifics otherwise they will be missed!
-Call to me - good job on noting that you needed help and giving vitals but you could give me a bit more of an interpretation of what you think is going on and why. That said, you needed the ECG to really know and we prompted you here.

The child was ultimately treated for anaphylaxis, however waiting to get a full assessment and review with me before starting treatment was the right decision.  It was a soft call for anaphylaxis (acute onset hives, subjective throat swelling after 2nd exposure to Nutella with 1st exposure having only mild facial symptoms).

08/02/2018,Resident_003,2.4,Faculty_002,Clinical Supervisor,4,Part A: Direct Observation and Review of Documentation - Form 1,emergency department,"Resident performed an I+D on a forearm abscess.  He anesthetized the area, used clean technique.  I encouraged him to do a loop I+D with a vascular tie (his original plan was to use packing).  Resident ensured all of the purulent material was expressed and thoroughly irrigated the wound - the literature is moving away from being so aggressive, as the loop will do all of this for you and outcomes are the same.  It's ok to do this as long as you don't cause too much discomfort.  Good decision to add Septra to treatment as the patient was high risk for an MRSA abscess.",

He provided appropriate anaesthetics, wound cleaning and communication around the procedure both pre and post.  He required some prompting around his technique for simple interrupted suture placement (specific to knots and tension) and in the recommendation to use a horizontal mattress suture in a gaping wound on the leg.  I also want to encourage Resident to avoid handling the needle with his fingers at all times- he did this infrequently but could further avoid risk by using instruments at all times.",
